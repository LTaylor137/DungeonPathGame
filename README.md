This is one of my first projects that I developed to better familiarise myself with the Angular environment as well as Javascript in general.

It is a simple game where the goal is to choose the optimal path to survive the dungeon and make it to the end.

Collect loot along the way, heal at campfires, and be ready to face tougher monsters.

Hover over items to see tooltips. See the options wheel at the top if you want to enable "god mode" or disable sound effects.


This was mostly tested at a resolution of 1920 x 1080, but the app should scale to different resolutions.

##### This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.4.
