This is a project I developed to familiarise myself more with the Angular environment.

It is a simple game where the player must choose the optimal path to survive the dungeon and make it to the end.
Collect loot along the way, heal at campfires, and be ready to face tougher monsters.

See the options wheel at the top if you want to enable "god mode" or disable sound effects.


This was mostly tested at a resolution of 1920 x 1080, but the app should scale to different resolutions.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.4.
